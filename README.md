## CS161L LAB 1
### Name: Justin Gafford(jgaff001)
There are no known errors or incomplete functionalities in this lab as I passed all 28 test written in the test bench. However, in my gradescope submission the autograder failed to execute giving this error:
```
The autograder failed to execute correctly. 
Contact your course staff for help in debugging this issue.
Make sure to include a link to this page so that they can help you most effectively.
```
As all the test pass on my local machine in the ISE Design Studio I believe that this is an error with the autograder rather than my own code. However, below is the link to the gradescope submission.
